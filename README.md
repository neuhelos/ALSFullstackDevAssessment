# ALS Full Stack Developer Exercise

In this repo, `index.html` is a simple, single-page React.js app.

The app reads in a JSON file of “user cards.” The goal is to extract information for each user from this JSON and display the information in an HTML table as shown below.

Your task is to clone this repo and complete the `Body` component to display the data in the table body. Most of the React code is already written for you.

It's OK if you have not worked in React before. Learning as you go is something this job will require plenty of. If you are unfamiliar with React, please refer to [this document][react components and props]  for help understanding “components” and “props” in particular.
